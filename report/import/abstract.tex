We present the results of an Sarsa($\lambda$) based agent with additional KL-USB and maximiser. The agent acts in several different environments with discrete state space and we exaplain two of them, tic-tac-toe and connect four.
Enabling the maximiser proved better in environments with large state spaces and KL-UCB did not yield better results than a Sarsa($\lambda$) with $\lambda = 0.2, \alpha = 1$.
