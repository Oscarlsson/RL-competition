This report details our submission to the Reinforcement Learning competition held in the course ``Decision making under uncertainty``~\cite{decmaking}. The competition was to implement a agent that would communicate with rl glue~\cite{rl-glue} and act in environments with discrete state spaces.
We implemented an agent that is built upon the ideas of Sarsa($\lambda$) and present the results of varying parameters and different approaches to exploration vs exploitation and on how to break ties.
