This report details our submission to the Reinforcement Learning competition
held in the course ``Decision making under uncertainty``~\cite{decmaking}. The
competition was to implement a agent that would communicate with
RL-Glue~\cite{rl-glue} and act in environments with discrete state spaces. We
implemented an agent that is built upon the ideas of
Sarsa($\lambda$)~\cite{Sutton:1998:IRL:551283} in combination with
KL-UCB~\cite{garivier2011kl} and we present the results of varying parameters
and different approaches to exploration vs exploitation and on how to break
ties.
