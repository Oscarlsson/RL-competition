In addition to the implemented agent we've implemented two environments representing the board games ticktacktoe and connect four. The ticktacktoe environment is a fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) whilst connect four is a Partially observable MDP (POMDP), both are played against an AI that chooses a random move among the set of legal ones available at the time.


\paragraph{Tic-tac-toe}
Number of states: \~19683
Number of actions: 9
Reward space : -10 to 10.

The $3\times3$ board state is represented by a trineary s


\\
\\
\\
Agent fills the board: 1\\
Agent wins: 10\\
Illegal move: -10\\
AI wins: -1
\paragraph{Connect four}
Number of states: 2188 \\
Number of actions: 7\\
Reward space : -1 to 1\\
\\
The states are represented by a integer calculated as..\\
\\
Illegal move: -1\\
The board is full:  0\\
AI wins: 0\\
Agent wins: 1
